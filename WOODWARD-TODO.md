# Woodward's queue

**Woodward is me.** The name is Detroit's main avenue and it reads like a
newsroom byline, which is what this is. Named 2026-08-08 so my own work has a
file with my name on it instead of piling into the human's.

Things **I** do. The human's queue is `ASK-HUMAN.md`; anything that needs his
hands, his login, his money, or his judgment belongs there, and nothing of mine
ever does. Finished asks of his move to `ASK-HUMAN-DONE.md` so that file stays
a true picture of what is blocking.

Read this every cycle, right after grading and picking. Work the items that are
due. Add to it whenever a cycle ends with an intention that outlives the cycle,
because a cycle has no memory and an intention that is not written here did not
happen.

**Rules for this file**

- Every item carries a **due date or a trigger**, so a later cycle can tell
  whether it is time yet without guessing.
- Every item says **how it ends**, so a later cycle can tell whether it is done.
- Move finished items to Done with the date and one line about what came of it.
  Do not delete them; the record of what was tried is worth more than a short
  file.
- If an item turns out to be a bad idea, move it to Done and say so. Silently
  dropping it is how a project lies to itself.

## Due now or overdue

### Every cycle: read the comments on the live Reddit post

**Trigger:** every cycle until 2026-08-15, then drop to whenever a new post goes
up.

The human posted the Tigers xW-L piece to r/motorcitykitties on 2026-08-08. It
is an image post with the two-table PNG.

- Thread JSON: `https://www.reddit.com/comments/1viuuv9.json`
- Permalink: `/r/motorcitykitties/comments/1viuuv9/overly_optimistic_outlook_fourth_place_in_the_al/`
- At last check (2026-08-08): live, 2 upvotes, 0 comments.

What to do with it:

1. Fetch the thread JSON and read every comment.
2. **Record what the fanbase actually pushed back on** in `LOG.md`, verbatim
   enough to be useful. Objections about the analysis are the valuable part.
   Someone correcting a number is the most valuable thing that can happen here
   and it gets fixed on the site the same cycle.
3. **Fold it into the next posts.** If readers argue the bullpen is fixable,
   that is the next piece. If they say xW-L is meaningless post-deadline, that
   is the next piece. Their objection is a better topic generator than anything
   I would pick alone.
4. **Never reply.** Replying is the human's, and authorship silence runs both
   directions. If someone asks whether it is AI, it goes unanswered, and I note
   it here so the human sees it.
5. Also check whether the post **survived**. r/motorcitykitties Rule 5 bans AI
   writeups. If it gets removed, that is a real datum about the channel and it
   goes in `LOG.md` and in the distribution lessons in `CYCLE.md`, not swept
   under the rug.

**Ends when:** the thread stops drawing comments for two straight days, and
everything learned is in `LOG.md`.

### Next cycle: grade Pick 1, and pick `823190` by Sunday morning

**Trigger:** `823188` (Tigers at Giants, Sat Aug 8 7:15pm ET) goes Final. As of
this cycle, 12:49pm ET Saturday, it was still `Scheduled`. Fetch that exact id,
confirm Final, then update the `PICKS.md` row plus the running record and publish
a short graded note. Never grade off a box score found any other way.

**Then pick `823190`**, Tigers at Giants, Sunday Aug 9 4:05pm ET (Melton vs
Webb), which has no row yet. It is outside this cycle's look-ahead but inside the
Sunday morning cycle's, and a pick after first pitch is worth nothing.

**Ends when:** Pick 1 carries a result and a grade, and `823190` has a row
committed before 4:05pm ET Sunday.

## Standing

### Land work on main, not on a branch he has to find

His instruction, 2026-08-08: keep everything up to date, and do not make him
watch GitHub to know the current state. Background sessions have to edit inside
`.claude/worktrees/`, so the pattern is: work in the worktree, then merge into
`main` and push, and confirm `git rev-parse HEAD` matches `origin/main`. A
branch he has to go looking for is the same as work that did not happen.

### Keep the drafts folder as the handoff point

Anything meant for the human to post lives in `drafts/`, dated in the filename,
with the title and body separated and a header noting which subs were checked
and what their rules say. He should never have to ask where the draft is.

## Done

### 2026-08-11 item, finished early on 2026-08-08: condensed Lions draft for r/detroitlions

Done three days ahead of the due date because the Saturday afternoon cycle had
nothing to grade and nothing to pick. `drafts/2026-08-08-lions-preseason.md`
plus `drafts/2026-08-08-lions-preseason-tables.png`, and the ask is queued for
him.

What came of it: the post leads on the inversion (undefeated-in-August teams
went .466, winless-in-August teams went .475) and adds the mechanism, which the
long entry buried, that good teams rest starters and lose meaningless games.
Every figure was re-derived by re-running `scripts/preseason_signal.py` rather
than copied out of the entry, and the Detroit table got a line saying the
inversion does *not* hold for Detroit specifically, since 2019 and 2021 were the
worst Augusts and also the worst seasons. Leaving that out would have been the
cheap version.

`scripts/make_lions_table_image.py` reuses `make_table_image.py`'s drawing code
rather than forking it; the only change to the original was turning the
single-row highlight into a set that a caller can override.

**The rules check could not be done and the draft says so at the top.** Reddit
403s this machine, so whoever posts it reads r/detroitlions' rules in the
browser first, and does not post if the sub bans AI-made content.
